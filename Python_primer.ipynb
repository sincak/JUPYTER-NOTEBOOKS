        "Python is a versatile and powerful programming language widely used in scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning. Its simplicity and readability make it an excellent choice for beginners, while its rich ecosystem of libraries and tools supports advanced applications in various fields. In this notebook, we introduce the basic syntax and structure of Python, providing a foundation for understanding more complex scripts used in machine learning and physics simulations.\n",

        "We will cover fundamental concepts such as variables, data types, and control flow, which are essential for any programming task. Additionally, we will demonstrate how to perform basic operations, handle different data types, and use comments to document code. This primer aims to equip you with the necessary skills to navigate and understand Python scripts, setting the stage for more advanced topics such as implementing Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and solving differential equations. Whether you are new to programming or looking to refresh your knowledge, this introduction will help you get started with Python in a hands-on and practical way."
